Rather than the original game, this version has some changes:

   - less limitations for orders:
       -stations can serve also vehicles of different companies
       -Railways can serve all companies vehicles (a rail tile can be modified only by the owner, so the owner can modify it in a way that other companies can use it's rail track)

   - less limitations for station construction:
              -multiple company can build tiles for the same station
              -a company can rebuild the station created by another company 


known bugs:

     -problems with train pathfinding on guest rail tracks 
      temporary solution : partially fixable with signals
      UPDATE: fixed modifying signal behavior


     -no kind of collisions between two trains of different companies
      UPDATE: fixed changing train collision behavior

     -pathfinding fails without signals on railways 

not tested:

      -boats on handling different companies harbors
